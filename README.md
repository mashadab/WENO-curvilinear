# WENO-curvilinear
This repository encloses Mathematica codes used in the paper [1] on Fifth order finite volume Weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme in orthogonally-curvilinear coordinates.

The two Mathematica codes are as follows:
1. Weight derivation: For uniform grids in cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates
2. Modified von-Neumann stability analysis (as performed in [2])
